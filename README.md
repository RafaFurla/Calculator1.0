# Calculator 1.0 

This project I created a calculator application with GUI (Graphical User Interface). 
The code was written in python 3.9 and the GUI was created using PyQt5 (biding for Qt Framework).

> This calculator has the following functions:
> * Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
> * Dot: .
> * Operations (+, -, *, /): sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.
> * Equal (=): calculate the operation chose by the user. 
> * Porcentage button: %
> * Cancel Entry button (CE): delete the entire number on the screen.
> * Backspace button (<-): delete the last number on the screen.
> * Clear Button (C): resets the calculator by clearing all memory and returning to the starting point. 

## Requirements

You have to maintein the file calculator.exe togeter with calculator.py (this file have the code) and calculator.ui (this file comands the grafical interface) inside the same directory.
